# IBM webMethods and StreamsSets Public Repositories Transition Area

This organization contains public repositories incoming from [Software AG](https://github.com/SoftwareAG) public github organization.

Here, the transferred repositories:

- maintain their original names
- maintain their stars and forks
- remain available to public github users
- are immediately frozen in a read-only state
- will be filtered for viability
- will be qualified in the near future and moved towards their final position, in one of IBM's organizations

Following IBM's acquisition of webMethods and StreamSets in 2024, the license owner of these repositories is changed from Software AG to IBM Corporation.

IBM Corporation does not offer any support or guarantees of any nature over the existing incoming contents.
